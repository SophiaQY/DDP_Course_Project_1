## Summary

This project is simply to create a markdown file, which has an interactive map in it. Here we use the map of New York City.

## 1. load the package.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
```

## 2. Create interactive map with randomly created 100 drop points and add clusters to the points.
```{r}
df <- data.frame(lat= runif(100, min=40.50, max=40.80),
                 lng= runif(100, min=-74.24, max=-73.76))
                
df%>%
        leaflet()%>%
        addTiles()%>%
        addMarkers(clusterOptions=markerClusterOptions())
```
